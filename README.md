# Tidzam: Ambient Sound Analysis

Tidzam is an ambient sound analysis system for outdoor environment. It is a component of the Tidmarsh project which monitors the environmental evolution of an industrial cramberry farm during its ecological restoration of wetland. Tidzam analyses the audio streams generated by the deployed microphones into the wild in order to detect the sonic events happening on the site,  such as bird calls, insects, frogs, rain, storms, car noise, human voices and others. This system is used to cross-validate other sensors for weather monitoring, to identify, geolocalize and track present wildlife and bird specimens over time. It also controls the audio mixers in order to mute or to change the gain on noisy microphones.

This system uses deeplearning technology in order to learn its classification tasks. A Human Computer Interface API provides tools to build a training database from the targeted sonic environment. A new task of classification could be boostraped by external audio recordings in order to create poor classifiers which will be refined by the addition of audio samples that the system automatically extracts from the environment. Therefore the system improves its accurancy after several generations of its iterative learning process.

# Get Started
Tidzam is composed of several independent processes which can require important ressources in terms of CPU, GPU and memory according to the classification tasks complexity and the number of processed audio streams. Its different processes are multi-threaded and can be deployed on a cluster-based architectures.

## Installation
Several external components are required by Tidzam and must be installed. Currently, the system has been tested on clusted based Ubuntu 16.04 with Titan X GPUs.
```
tidzam install
```

### Dependencies
Tidzam has been implemented on Python 3.x and uses the following external components:
* [**JACK server**](#JACK-Server) is a low latency audio mixer server which routes the audio streams between the different components of the system. It is managed by the [TidzamStreamManager](#TidzamStreamManager) which loads the incoming audio sources, configure them and monitor the JACK server. Manual client configurations can be operated without conflict with the [TidzamStreamManager](#TidzamStreamManager).
* [**Icecast server**](#Icecast-Server) pushs the audio streams processed by the system to a Web interface in order to allow the clients to listen all the streams independently. This functionnality is required when the incoming audio sources contains a lot of channels (like in OPUS encoding) which cannot be played with a classical audio player. Each channel of the audio input sources is splited into an independant mono channel.
* **MPV and FFMPEG** are used to load the incoming audio sources in JACK server and to push them to the Icecast server.
* **Tensorflow** is the deeplearning framework on which is implemented Tidzam. It is recommended to install its GPU-enabled version for real-time processing and for CPU load / memory saving.
* **Python Package Dependencies:**
```
python3
python-scipy
python-matplotlib
python-socketio
socketIO_client
sounddevice
json
jack-mixer
```

## Starting
The tidzam script can be used to start, stop and restart all the processes on a single server architecture with one system command. The check option verifies that the system is running properly and restart it if not.
```
tidzam [start | stop | restart | check]
```

# Architecture

![alt text](static/img/architecture.png "General Architecture Scheme")

## TidzamStreamManager
TidzamStreamManager feeds the JACK server with audio streams, denoted sources, which are routed to the Icecast Server and the TidzamAnalyzer. Currently all audio formats supported by MPV can be used on Tidzam such as MPV is responsible to load the sources on the JACK Server. A source can be a local file on the server, a Web URL or a LiveStream. A [LiveStream](#Live-Stream-Management) is a PCM16bits stream pushed through socket.io to the TidzamStreamManager. It can be for example a recording from the microphone of a mobile device.
```
Usage: TidzamStreamManager.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --buffer-size=BUFFER_SIZE
                        Set the Jack ring buffer size in seconds (default: 100
                        seconds).
  --samplerate=SAMPLERATE
                        Set the sample rate (default: 44100).
  --port-available=LIVE_PORT
                        Number of available ports for live streams.
                        (default: 10).
  --port=PORT           Socket.IO Web port (default: 8080).
  --tidzam-socketio=TIDZAM_ADDRESS
                        Socket.IO address of the tidzam server (default:
                        localhost:8001).
  --sources=SOURCES     JSON file containing the list of the initial audio
                        source streams (default: None).
  --debug=DEBUG         Set debug level (Default: 0).
```
An initial JSON config file can be provided to the manager (--sources options) in order to automatically load some sources at the starting. In such case, they are automatically defined such as permanent sources which means that if the streaming is disconnected, the system will automatically try to reload them periodically.

##### JSON config file
```
{
  "sources":[
    {
      "name":"impoundment",
      "url":"http://doppler.media.mit.edu:8000/impoundment.opus",
      "path_database":"/mnt/tidmarsh-audio/impoundment-mc",
      "nb_channels":30
    },
      {
        "name":"herring",
        "url":"http://doppler.media.mit.edu:8000/herring.ogg",
        "path_database":"/mnt/tidmarsh-audio/herring",
        "nb_channels":1
      }
  ]
}
```

### JACK Server
The JACK Server can handle a lot of different clients which can increase drastically the CPU load til saturating the system ressources. Several parameters should be adapted according to the number of streams that Tidzam is supposed to handle according to the available ressources of the server.

* **--port-max** defines the maximum number of clients that the JACK servers will authorize. It is the safety lock in Tidzam to protect the system load. This parameter bounds Tidzam such as if the maximum number of clients is reached, the TidzamStreamManager will not be able to load new sources. An audio source in Tidzam consums in the worth case and by source: (3 x #NumberOfSources x #LoadedChannels). The

* **-r** desactivates the real-time mode (if the OS doesn't support it) or if the system load cannot handle it.

* **-t** defines the timeout to kick out a jack client. When a client is disconnected, the TidzamStreamManager will automatically try to reload it. If the client is disconnected because it is too slow to response to JACK server due to the system load, then its restarting will produce the disconnection of another one and them trigger a cascade of failures. In order to avoid such situation, the timeout should be enough large to avoid disconnection due to system load or the number of client MUST be reduced with the --port-max option.

* **-ddumpy** defines a dumpy audio driver for JACK server in order to not lock the hardware sound device.

* **-r** defines the sample rate of JACK server (must be the same that one of Tidzam).

* ** -pXXXX ** defines the size XXXX of JACK buffer used by the client and so their latency. An higher value increases the system latency but decrease the CPU load. It must be a power of two value.
```
jackd  --port-max 2048 -v -r -t50000 -ddummy -r44100 -p8192
```

### Icecast Server
The Icecast Server receives the audio streams from different FFMPEG clients which are started and managed by the TidzamStreamManager. Any format supported by FFMPEG can be used as output stream on the Icecast server. The special copy mode of FFMPEG can be also used in order to copy directly the input source to Icecast output without encoding-decoding process (see [Source Management  - Source Loading](#Source-Loading)). This feature is used when the input source contains more channels (like in OPUS stream) than FFMPEG can decode.

### Socket.IO Interface
TidzamStreamManager has a socket.io interface in order to manage the sources during its runtime.
#### Source Management
A source can be loaded from a remote URL, from a local file or from a [LiveStream](#Live-Stream-Management). A permanent source can also have a local database composed of its previous recordings with their filename formatted by *database_name-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.{ogg | opus | wav}* (see [JSON config file](#JSON-config-file)). Therefore the request of source loading can select the proper file to load through the field *date*. If the date is in the future, the *URL* field will be loaded as the online audio stream. By default all channels are loaded but a list of channels can be also provided through the field *channels*. If the field *is_permanent* is turn on True (default is False), this source would be considered as permanent and will be restarted in case of termination. If the field format (default is ogg) is turn on copy, the TidzamStreamManager will use the FFMEPG copy option to push the stream in Icecast without any encoding-decoding processing.

##### Source Loading
*Request on "sys" event:*
```
{
  'sys':{
    'loadsource':{
      'name':'mynewsource',
      'url':'https://',
      'database':'database_name',
      'date':'YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS'
      'channels':"channel4,test_chan5,...",
      'is_permanent':True | False,
      'format':'ogg | copy'
    }
  }
}
```

##### Source Unloading

          [...]
        ]
      }, ...
    }
  }
}

```

#### Live Stream Management

##### New Live Stream
A LiveStream is automatically created and connected to the Icecast server and TidzamAnalyzer when its data is received on socket.io event *"audio"* from a client.
The audio stream MUST be in PCM16bits format. The system will generate a unique portname identifier based on the socket.io SID of the client which can be request by:
Getting the created portname:

** Request on "sys":**
```
{
   'sys':{
      'add_livestream':''
   }
}
```
** Response on "sys":**
```
{
  'sys':{
    'portname':'name'
  }
}
```
##### Close a live stream
** Request on "sys":**
```
{
   'sys':{
      'del_livestream':''
   }
}
```

## TidzamAnalyzer
### Input Stream Loading
TidzamAnalyzer plays the different loaded classifiers on its input streams which can be a regular audio file (*--stream* argument) or source channels from the Jack server (*--jack* argument).  TidzamStreamManager does not connect the sources to the TidzamAnalyzer, it must be indicated in *--jack* argument as a list of portname pattern machings (for example *impoudment-* will connect all portname starting by this prefix).

### Hierarchical Expert Architecture
The classifiers, that must be loaded, are specified by the *--nn* argument. They can be cascaded if there is a pattern matching between their classe name. The primary classifier must be named by *selector*. If a classifier contains a classe that matchs the name of another classifier, then the output classe of the first classifier weights all classes of the second one. (For example, the classe *birds* of the *selector* classifier weights the classe of the bird specimen classifier named *birds*).

### Automatic Sample Extraction
TidzamAnalyzer has an optional module for automatic sample extraction which would be stored in the folder specified by *--out* argument. The sample extraction can specific on one port and depend of a pattern matching in the classe names (for example *birds-* will extract all detected sample with this prefix like *birds-american_crow* or *birds-canada_goose*). If the argument *--extract-dd* is specified, the decision of sample extraction is depend of a probability distribution representing the number of sample for each classe stored in *--out*. These rules can be defined for each channel during the runtime trough socket.io interface (see [Extraction rules](#Extraction-rules)).

# Tidzam Training
The TidzamTrain process has a cluster-based implementation of *Asynchronous Between-graph Replication* which allows the training to be executed in parallel on several GPUs distributed on several machines. A Parameter Server (ps) is responsible to aggregate and share the weights between the different distributed workers. If TidzamTrain is executed without explicit cluster configuration (see *--workers*, *--ps*, *--task-index* and *--job*), only local GPUs will be used. The training and testing datasets can be provided by two approaches:
* **On the fly** A set of independent workers generate on live the batchs directly from the audio file folders specified in *--dataset-train*. Based on an online file indexing, some files are used for the training and some others for the validation (hardcoded rate of 80%). A master process is managing the sample batch queue in order to deliver them to the different workers of the training process.

* **Compiled Dataset** approach uses datasets which has been processed offline with the [Database Editor](#Database-Editor) or [Database Tool](#Database-Tool). A dataset is composed of several archives containing the audio FFT samples with their labels. The dataset MUST be manually randomize and splitted into the two training and a validation datasets which must be provided to the trainer with the arguments *--dataset-train* and *--dataset-test*.
